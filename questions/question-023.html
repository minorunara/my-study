A shared file system also runs on several EC2 instances that store 200 TB of data. The application reads and modifies the data on the shared file system and generates a report. The job runs once monthly, reads a subset of the files from the shared file system, and takes about 72 hours to complete. The compute instances scale in an Auto Scaling group, but the instances that host the shared file system run continuously. The compute and storage instances are all in the same AWS Region.A solutions architect needs to reduce costs by replacing the shared file system instances. The file system must provide high performance access to the needed data for the duration of the 72-hour run.Which solution will provide the LARGEST overall cost reduction while meeting these requirements?</div>

                <div class="comment-content">Answer: D

I think the main point here is to understand what they mean by "The file system must provide high performance access to the needed data" while "provide the LARGEST overall cost reduction"?

For answer A, we have to remember that lazy load is SLOW for the first time you try to access the file (as it is being fetched from S3), BUT, as we are talking about hundreds of instances, then it might be OK. S3 Intelligent-Tiering, although doesn't seem to fit much, the part that says "The job runs once monthly, reads a subset of the files from the shared file system", indicates that at least part of the 200TB of data won't be accessed, which helps not going for answer C, for example.

My only issue with answer D is that Storage Gateway can be slower than FSx for Lustre, HOWEVER, what is the cost X performance ratio they are seeking here? We can guess that costs trumps maximum performance here: "Which solution will provide the LARGEST overall cost reduction" and, as Storage Gateway is way cheaper than FSx for Lustre per TB, it's safe to say that D is the most correct answer.</div>

                <div class="comment-content">Functional requirements should be met before non-functional requirements.
In the first place, only option D allows the application to change the data in the shared file during the monthly job execution. With options A and C, data changes made during the job are discarded after the job runs.
On top of that, although D is inferior to A in performance, it meets the requirements because it is the cheapest.</div>

                <div class="comment-content">Problem with D is that, AWS Storage GW and File GW are solutions for integrating on-premise storage with AWS storage solutions, particularly (but not limited to) S3.

https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/
https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/file

Compute resources are residing in AWS, so having Storage GW and File GW won't solve a thing.
As far as option B is concerned, it comes down to the limitations of EBS (such as the max block size, and max number of instance that can be attached etc). Also, attaching and detaching of the EBS volumes seems a bit complicated too. On top of that, EBS does not offer the cost optimizations offered by S3 Intelligent Tiering. The question clearly mentions that only a subset of the data will be used. Intelligent tiering ensures a substantial cost optimization over time.
Hence, the answer should be A.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="comment-content">By choosing Option A, the company can leverage the cost-effectiveness of Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering for storage and the high performance of Amazon FSx for Lustre for temporary file access, while minimizing the overall cost by creating and deleting the file system only when needed.
Option B (using Amazon EBS Multi-Attach) is not ideal because EBS volumes are designed for persistent storage, and attaching and detaching a large volume to multiple instances can be time-consuming and potentially disruptive.
Option C (using Amazon FSx for Lustre with batch loading) is less cost-effective than Option A because batch loading requires loading the entire 200 TB of data into the file system, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
Option D (using AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway) is not the most cost-effective solution because the File Gateway is designed for on-premises file storage integration and may not provide the same level of performance as FSx for Lustre for this data-intensive workload.</div>
